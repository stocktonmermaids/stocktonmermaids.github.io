    <h3>Head Coach & Team Manager</h3>
    <h4>Matthew Harris</h4>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Matthew, my wife and I choose to start this team based on these simple principles:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Softball is a game, and should be enjoyed by everyone</li>
        <li>Everyone should get to play on Saturday</li>
        <li>Miss a practice, miss a game</li>
        <li>Late to a practice, don't start a game</li>
        <li>Work Hard; Great Attuide; Have Fun</li>

    <h3>Bench Coach & Team Mom</h3>
    <h4>Victoria Harris</h4>
    <p>
      As a mother it was heart breaking to watch girls being nasty to each other, faviortism, and coaches bickering with each other. 
      This is why I support and encourged my husband Matthew to start our own team. 
      We are not perfect but will try our best to be fair and encourage all the girls.

    <p>
      My name is Nanea, but I am better known as "Samurai" I have played softball since I was 7. I have played rec-league, travel, and am currently a captin on my high school team. 
      Softball has always been a big part of who I am. I love the game and teaching to others, I hope I can spread the love of softball and spark a passion in younger players. 
      I am excited to have lots of fun with our little ball players and help mold them into skillful athlets in both mind and body.

    <h4>Eden Long</h4>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Eden or as most know me Edi. I have loved the game since I was little though I actually started out in baseball and started softball in High school. 
      I play along side Angelina and Nanea, and am a captain with Nanea. I love being on the field! There is always a challenge and there is always something to work on and reason I can grow. 
      Honestly I also love the friends I have made and my team. I can't wait to meet and work with everyone, teaching skills that will help on the field and in many other parts of life.
