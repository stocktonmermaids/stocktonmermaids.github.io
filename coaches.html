    <h3>Head Coach & Team Manager</h3>
    <h4>Matthew Harris</h4>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Matthew, my wife and I choose to start this team based on these simple principles:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Softball is a game, and should be enjoyed by everyone</li>
        <li>Everyone should get to play on Saturday</li>
        <li>Miss a practice, miss a game</li>
        <li>Late to a practice, don't start a game</li>
        <li>Work Hard; Great Attitude; Have Fun</li>

    <h3>Assistant Coach</h3>
    <h4>Tony Long</h4>
    <p>
      I met Matthew at the beginning of the 2022 Venture Academy High School season. 
      Eden my daughter informed me there was a new coach, and he was working alone. 
      I asked if I could be of assistance and help at practices. 
      Matthew made me the assistant coach there on the spot and we've been working together since. 
      High School, Rec-League, Jr. Giants, and now his daughters travel team.

    <h3>Bench Coach & Team Mom</h3>
    <h4>Victoria Harris</h4>
    <p>
      As a mother I have loved watching my daughter grow in the sport of softball, a sport that she loves, the bounds and friendships she has made along the way, and all the wonderful people we have meet.
      I started as the bench coach for her t-ball team five years ago and helped through rec-league. I am excited to start a new local Stockton team with my husband Matthew.
